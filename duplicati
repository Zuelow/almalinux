I would like to also bring attention to the new experimental release (soon the next beta), which does not rely on libappindicator or mono.

You can get the RPM packages from here:
https://updates.duplicati.com/experimental

With that is should be a matter of just running:

yum localinstall duplicati-2.1.0.0_experimental_2024-11-15-linux-x64-gui.r
